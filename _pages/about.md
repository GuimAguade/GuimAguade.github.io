I am a physicist with a PhD in Biomedicine. I study complex biological systems, where many interacting components —from cells to species— can lead to emergent system properties.

During my PhD in Barcelona (Spain), I developed mathematical models of cancer ecology and evolution, focusing on the interplay between cancer and the immune system to predict the success or failure of immunotherapy. As a postdoctoral fellow in Montpellier (France), my research examines species-rich ecological and microbial communities, exploring how biodiversity influences ecosystem resilience and vulnerability to perturbations.
